# 📚 Python External Libraries

Welcome to my collection of Python 🐍 programs using external (third-party) libraries 📦. This public repository is created to document my learning journey and share simple, well-commented examples for others who are exploring Python beyond the standard library.

## ✨ Purpose
- To practice and understand how different libraries work
- To keep a personal reference of commonly used modules
- To help beginners with easy-to-follow code examples

## 📁 Structure
Each program focuses on:
- A specific feature or use-case of an external library
- Clear and simple logic
- Comments to explain each step

> 📌 *Note: This repo is code-only – no installation guides or deep documentation. Pure hands-on practice.*

## 🎓 Who Can Use This?
- Python beginners 🆕  
- Students learning third-party modules 📘  
- Anyone looking for short code references 🛠️

## 🤝 Contributions
This is a personal project, so external contributions are currently not open. However, you're welcome to fork, explore, and learn from the code!
